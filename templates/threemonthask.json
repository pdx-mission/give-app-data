Food and water are scarce, dehydration and heatstroke are common, and the threat of violence and sickness is everywhere. But your gift today can provide a hope for a home for our neighbors in need. Thank you for providing meals, shelter, life-restoring programs, and compassionate support. You are appreciated!</p>",
